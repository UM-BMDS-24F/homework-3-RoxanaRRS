BLAST Program (blastp):





The blastp program compares protein sequences. Since we're looking for homologous sequences between human and mouse proteins, blastp makes sense. Protein sequences can be compared effectively to identify evolutionary relationships.



Substitution Matrix:





As a default, blastp uses BLOSUM62 as its substitution matrix.



BLOSUM62 is suitable for sequences with 62% similarity and is widely used for protein alignments. Scores alignments between sequences that have diverged over evolution, like those between humans and mice.



Choice of Parameters:





E-value (1e-5): This limits the output to significant matches. An E-value of 1e-5 suggests that matches with a chance of being random are less than 0.001%. This helps to filter out noise and retain biologically relevant alignments.



Output Format (outfmt=5): This specifies the output format as XML, which is easier to parse with Biopython, allowing us to extract detailed information about each alignment.
